Introduction
============

**GeoNode Cloud** is an advanced implementation of the `GeoNode <https://github.com/GeoNode/geonode>`_ platform in the cloud, focused on maximizing the use of native or adapted technologies for cloud environments. This solution is designed to be deployed on Kubernetes, which facilitates its scalability, management and resilience.

GeoNode Cloud incorporates the `GeoServer Cloud <https://github.com/geoserver/geoserver-cloud>`_ project, which provides robust support for the publication, editing and management of geospatial data, thus reinforcing its purpose of offering a modern and efficient infrastructure for the management of geospatial information in the cloud.

With GeoNode Cloud, organizations can benefit from greater flexibility, reduced operational costs, and seamless integration with other cloud-native tools and services.
